        <h2>Understanding Risk/Reward Ratios</h2>
        <p>The Risk/Reward Ratio is a measure used to evaluate the potential return of a trade compared to the potential loss. It helps traders determine whether the potential reward justifies the risk involved. This ratio is crucial in managing trades and making informed decisions to enhance profitability.</p>
        <p><strong>Risk:</strong> The potential loss if the trade does not go as planned.</p>
        <p><strong>Reward:</strong> The potential gain if the trade succeeds.</p>
